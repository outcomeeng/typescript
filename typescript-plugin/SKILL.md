  ALWAYS invoke this skill to operate the typescript plugin's own lifecycle in a checkout — report its version, manage whatever checkout footprint this plugin owns on the running agent, and check that footprint. Invoke it when this plugin's agents are missing from a session. NEVER hand-copy a plugin's agent definitions into a checkout or hand-edit them once placed.

<objective>
The typescript plugin's consumer-side footprint reported, placed, or refreshed in the invocation checkout, bounded to the namespace this plugin owns.
</objective>

<verbs>

Read `$ARGUMENTS`, trim it, and match it against the table below. One verb runs per invocation; `help` is the default when `$ARGUMENTS` is empty. Text matching no row is an error naming the five verbs, never a guessed match.

| Verb      | Result                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `help`    | This plugin's verbs, what each one changes, and where its changelogs are             |
| `version` | The plugin version the running session resolved                                      |
| `init`    | This plugin's checkout footprint established for this version †                      |
| `upgrade` | This plugin's checkout footprint brought to this version, retiring what it dropped † |
| `check`   | Whether the checkout's footprint matches this version, changing nothing †            |

† This agent's plugin manifest declares the plugin's agents, so they reach a session through the manifest and no checkout placement applies. `init`, `upgrade`, and `check` report that and change nothing here; they carry the footprint work only for an agent whose manifest cannot declare agents.

</verbs>

<changelogs>

`help` names where a reader answers "what changed for me, and what must I now do?". Each line runs on its own clock. The marketplace and plugin lines ship inside every installed plugin; the methodology line ships only where its providing plugin is installed. Whichever are present are read from disk, without network access. Read one only when the reader asks what changed; never read all three by default.

| Line        | Records                                                  | Path                                                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Marketplace | events no single plugin owns: harnesses, plugins renamed | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/MARKETPLACE-CHANGELOG.md`                                  |
| Plugin      | what changed in this plugin                              | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../CHANGELOG.md`                                                   |
| Methodology | edition transitions, compatible extensions, deprecations | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../METHODOLOGY-CHANGELOG.md`, shipped only in the spec-tree plugin |

Every plugin installed from one marketplace snapshot carries the same marketplace line, because a plugin rename is unreadable from the renamed plugin once its old identity stops resolving. Plugins installed or refreshed at different times carry different snapshots, so this copy is current only as far as its newest entry — the topmost `##` heading, since entries run newest first. Report that date alongside the marketplace line so the reader can tell whether a later event falls outside this copy. The methodology path above resolves only from the spec-tree plugin's own skill directory; from any other plugin, reach it by invoking the spec-tree plugin's own lifecycle skill, never by guessing a cross-plugin path. That invocation is this skill's only use of the `Skill` tool, which is why the frontmatter grants it everywhere except the spec-tree plugin's own copy — a second call site added here needs that condition revisited. A checkout without that plugin has no methodology changelog to read, and that absence is normal rather than a fault.

</changelogs>

<version_reporting>

`version` reports the version of the plugin directory the session actually resolved. Read exactly one file:

```text
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

That path is relative to this skill's own directory, so it resolves inside whichever plugin copy the session loaded. A session may resolve a plugin from its marketplace source tree or from a versioned cache snapshot, and those diverge — so the version a reader needs is the one backing the running session, never the newest on disk elsewhere. Every plugin tree carries both manifest directories; read the one named above and never the other, because only that one is authoritative for the agent this copy was rendered for.

</version_reporting>

<placement>

Placement does not apply on this agent: its plugin manifest declares the plugin's agents, so the installer delivers them and no file is written into the checkout. The bundled script reports that and exits without changing anything; the call that reports it looks like this:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/place_agents.py" --checkout <repository-root>
```

`init`, `upgrade`, and `check` all report the same and write nothing, because this plugin's agents reach a session through the manifest rather than through the checkout.

</placement>

<persistence>

This agent receives the plugin's agents through its manifest, so the checkout carries no agent files from this plugin and this verb commits nothing.

</persistence>

<ownership_boundary>

This plugin claims no file in the checkout on this agent, because its manifest delivers the agents and no verb writes.

</ownership_boundary>

<failure_modes>

**Claude reported the version from a manifest elsewhere on disk.**

A marketplace source tree and a cache snapshot both carry a manifest, and they diverge, and each plugin tree carries a manifest directory per agent. The reported version described a plugin the session was not running. Read the one skill-directory-relative path `<version_reporting>` names, resolving it rather than searching for a manifest.

</failure_modes>

<success_criteria>

- Exactly one verb runs per invocation, defaulting to `help`.
- `version` reads only the skill-directory-relative manifest path named above, never another copy on disk.
- A reported marketplace date equals the topmost `##` heading in the marketplace changelog this plugin carries.
- A methodology-changelog request always resolves through the spec-tree plugin's own lifecycle skill, never a guessed cross-plugin path, and reports that plugin's absence as normal when it is not installed.
- Every footprint verb reports that the manifest delivers this plugin's agents, and writes nothing.

</success_criteria>
